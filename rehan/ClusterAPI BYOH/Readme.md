# Cluster API BYOH: Bare Metal Kubernetes Automation

This project provides a fully automated solution for provisioning Kubernetes clusters on bare metal servers using Cluster API (CAPI) and the Bring Your Own Host (BYOH) provider. It leverages Ansible for orchestration and configuration management, allowing you to turn raw Linux servers into production-ready Kubernetes clusters with a single JSON configuration file.

## 📋 Features & Support

- **Supported OS:** Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, 24.04
- **Kubernetes Versions:** Up to v1.34
- **Architecture:** Linux AMD64
- **Orchestration:** Automated via Ansible & Cluster API
- **Networking:** Calico CNI, Kube-Vip for Control Plane HA

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure your Management Machine and Target Hosts meet the following requirements.

### 1. Target Server Requirements

The target servers (the machines that will become your workload clusters) must have:

- **SSH Access:** Password-less sudo or a known user/password (configured in `input.json`)
- **Internet Access:** Required to fetch K8s binaries and manifests
- **Hostname Rule:** Hostnames MUST be lowercase. Kubernetes does not support uppercase characters in server names.
  - ✅ Correct: `hpe-server-01`
  - ❌ Incorrect: `HPE-Server-01`

### 2. Configure Ansible Authentication

You must configure one of the following authentication methods for Ansible to connect to your target servers:

#### 💡 Recommendation

**Use Option A (SSH Keys).** It is the standard way to manage Linux servers. It prevents issues where `sshpass` might hang or fail due to "Host Key Verification" prompts. Since you already have access to all servers, running `ssh-copy-id` 5 times will take you less than 2 minutes and save you headaches later.

#### **Option A: Use SSH Keys (Recommended & Best)**

This is the "Critical Pre-Requisite" mentioned. It is better because it is more secure and Ansible doesn't get stuck on password prompts.

**How to do it:**

1. **SSH into your Management server:**

   ```bash
   ssh username@management-server-ip
   # Enter your password when prompted
   ```

2. **Generate a Key Pair on your Management server** *(Do not enter a passphrase when asked, just press Enter)*:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa
   ```

3. **Copy this Key to ALL serverw (including itself):** You will run this command from your management server. It will ask for the password one last time for each server.

   ```bash
   # Copy to target server
   ssh-copy-id username@server-01-ip
   ssh-copy-id username@server-02-ip
   ssh-copy-id username@server-03-ip
   # ... repeat for all target servers

   ```

4. **Test it:** From your management server, try `ssh username@server-01-ip`. If it logs in without a password, you are ready!

**Config Change:**

- Leave `host_pwd` **empty** `""` in your `input.json`
- Keep the `# ansible_password` line **commented out** in `site.yaml`

---

#### **Option B: Use Passwords (If you skip Keys)**

If you do **not** want to generate keys and just want to use passwords, you can configure Ansible to use it.

**How to do it:**

1. **Install** `sshpass` **on** `hpe18`: Ansible needs this tool to handle text passwords.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install sshpass
   ```

2. **Update** `input.json`: You must put the password in the file for every host.

   ```json
   {
     "host_id": 1,
     "host_name": "server-01",
     "host_ip": "192.168.1.10",
     "host_user": "ubuntu",
     "host_pwd": "your-password"  
   }
   ```

3. **Update** `site.yaml`: You must **uncomment** the password line in `site.yaml`.

   **Current:**
   ```yaml
   # ansible_password: "{{ item.host_pwd }}"
   ```

   **Change to:**
   ```yaml
   ansible_password: "{{ item.host_pwd }}"
   ```

### 3. Connectivity Check

Run the following commands on ALL target servers to verify they can reach the necessary repositories:

```bash
ping -c3 raw.githubusercontent.com
nslookup raw.githubusercontent.com
```

If these fail, check your DNS or Firewall settings before proceeding.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Initialize Management Cluster

Run the `mgmt.sh` script on your bootstrap machine (e.g., your laptop or a dedicated bastion host). This script installs dependencies (Docker/Containerd, Kubectl, Ansible) and initializes the CAPI management cluster.

```bash
chmod +x mgmt.sh
./mgmt.sh
```

**What this does:**

- Installs system dependencies and Kubernetes binaries
- Bootstraps a local Kubernetes management cluster using kubeadm
- Installs Cluster API, BYOH Provider, Cert Manager, and ArgoCD
- Patches the BYOH controller to use the enhanced image (`rehanfazal47/byoh-controller:controller-enhancced`)

### Step 2: Define Infrastructure (input.json)

Edit the `input.json` file to define your available physical hosts and how you want to group them into clusters.

**Strict Rules for input.json:**

- `host_name`: Must match the actual hostname of the machine (lowercase)
- `host_id`: Must be unique for every host
- `host_ip`: Must be resolvable or a direct IP address

**Example input.json:**

```json
{
  "hosts": [
    {
      "host_id": 1,
      "host_name": "server-01",
      "host_ip": "192.168.1.10",
      "host_user": "ubuntu",
      "host_pwd": "password123"
    },
    {
      "host_id": 2,
      "host_name": "server-02",
      "host_ip": "192.168.1.11",
      "host_user": "ubuntu",
      "host_pwd": "password123"
    }
  ],
  "clusters": [
    {
      "cluster_name": "production-cluster",
      "cluster_masters": [ { "host_id": 1 } ],
      "cluster_workers": [ { "host_id": 2 } ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Provision and Deploy

Run the Ansible playbook to prepare the hosts, install the BYOH agent, and deploy the defined clusters.

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yaml
```

**What happens next:**

- **Keys & Inventory:** Ansible rotates the bootstrap tokens and creates an in-memory inventory from `input.json`
- **Host Prep:** Connects to hosts, disables swap, loads kernel modules, installs containerd and K8s binaries (v1.34 or version specified in playbook)
- **Agent Deployment:** Starts the `byoh-hostagent` on the targets
- **Cluster Creation:** Generates manifests from `cluster.yaml.j2` and applies them to the management cluster
- **Pinning:** Automatically labels the agents so the specific physical host is assigned to the specific cluster role defined in your JSON

## ⚙️ Operations Guide

### How to Add New Clusters or Nodes

To scale your infrastructure, you do not need to start over.

1. **Edit input.json:**
   - To add a node: Add a new entry to the `"hosts"` array and assign its `host_id` to a cluster's `cluster_workers` list
   - To add a cluster: Add a new object to the `"clusters"` array

2. **Re-run Ansible:**
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook site.yaml
   ```

Ansible is idempotent; it will skip already configured hosts and only provision the new ones.

### How to Delete Clusters

To remove a workload cluster (this will wipe the nodes associated with it):

```bash
# List all clusters
kubectl get clusters

# Delete a specific cluster
kubectl delete cluster <cluster_name>
```

**Note:** This deletes the Kubernetes cluster object. The physical machines will remain running but will be released by the BYOH controller. To reuse them, you may need to clean up the `byoh-hostagent` process on the target server.

### Changing Kubernetes Versions

To change the version of Kubernetes being deployed:

1. Open `site.yaml`
2. Locate `target_k8s_version: "1.34.0"` (under Play 2 variables)
3. Update it to your desired version (e.g., `1.30.0`)
4. Ensure `cluster_k8s_version` (under Play 3 variables) matches (e.g., `v1.30.0`)

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### 1. Ansible fails to connect to hosts

- Ensure SSH keys are copied (`ssh-copy-id user@host`) or the password in `input.json` is correct
- Check if `python3` is installed on the target

### 2. Cluster(or Nodes) stuck in "Provisioning" state

Check the agent logs on the target host:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/byoh.log
```

Ensure the host ID labeling worked by running `kubectl get byohosts --show-labels` on the management machine.

### 3. "Hostname not found"

Verify that `hostname` command on the target server returns a lowercase name that exactly matches `host_name` in `input.json`.

# O-RAN Multi-Cluster LCM Architecture (Draft)

> **Note:** This is a **rough architectural approach** as of now and may undergo further refinements as implementation progresses.

---

## Overview

This architecture outlines an initial approach for building an **O-RAN Multi-Cluster Lifecycle Management (LCM) Platform** using **Rancher**, **ArgoCD**, and **O2IMS**.  
It aims to support automated infrastructure management, workload orchestration, and O-RAN component deployment across distributed edge clusters.

---

## Architecture Summary

### **Management Cluster (Rancher + ArgoCD + O2IMS)**
- **Rancher**  
  - Manages multiple clusters (provisioning, RBAC, monitoring).  
  - Provides an abstraction layer over Kubernetes clusters.

- **ArgoCD**  
  - GitOps engine for declarative deployment and synchronization.  
  - Uses ApplicationSets for multi-cluster app deployment.  
  - Handles auto-rollback and continuous delivery from Git repositories.

- **O2IMS (O2 Interface Management Service)**  
  - Provides O2-compliant APIs for infrastructure exposure to the SMO.  
  - Handles infrastructure inventory and resource management.  
  - Serves as the link between SMO and Rancher/ArgoCD layers.

- **Git Repository**  
  - Hosts all O-RAN manifests and Helm charts.  
  - Acts as the source of truth for ArgoCD.

---

### **Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) Layer**
- **SMO**  
  - Central orchestrator for service policies, lifecycle automation, and dashboarding.  
  - Interfaces with O2IMS via O2 APIs to manage infrastructure resources.

- **OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance)**  
  - Uses O1 interface for FCAPS (Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security) management.  
  - Manages network configurations and monitoring data.

- **Non-RT RIC**  
  - Performs AI/ML-based training and policy optimization.  
  - Communicates with Near-RT RIC over the A1 interface.

---

### **Edge Clusters**
Each edge cluster hosts a portion of the RAN stack, deployed via ArgoCD from Git.

- **Near-RT RIC**  
  - Executes real-time RAN control functions and hosts xApps.  
  - Connects to O-RAN components using the E2 interface.

- **O-CU-CP / O-CU-UP / O-DU / O-RU**  
  - Represent the disaggregated RAN components for control, user plane, and radio operations.

---

### **External Systems and Interfaces**
- **O-RAN Interfaces**  
  - **O1**: OAM ↔ RAN  
  - **O2**: O2IMS ↔ SMO  
  - **A1**: Non-RT RIC ↔ Near-RT RIC  
  - **E2**: Near-RT RIC ↔ RAN Stack


### This is just a thought, will be considered only after completion of the main project 
- **Observability Stack**  
  - Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager for metrics and alerts.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**  
  - GitHub/GitLab-based pipelines for automated testing and image deployment.

---

## Key Data Flows

| Flow Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Management/Control Flow** | Rancher and ArgoCD managing clusters and workloads. |
| **O-RAN Standard Interfaces** | Communication between SMO, RICs, and RAN stack components. |
| **Data/GitOps Sync** | Continuous deployment and synchronization from Git repositories. |

---

## Development Notes

- This design currently represents a **conceptual implementation plan**.  
- Additional integration details, such as **O2IMS → Rancher API mapping** and **multi-cluster networking**, will be finalised in later phases.  
- Future enhancements may include **Terraform automation**, **multi-tenant policies**, and **Cilium-based network extensions**.
